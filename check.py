Certainly, here's an explanation of the hyperparameters of a SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model in simple terms:

p (Autoregressive Order - Non-seasonal):

This parameter represents how much the current value of the time series depends on its past values.
Higher values of p indicate that the current value is influenced by more past values.
d (Differencing Order - Non-seasonal):

Differencing helps make the time series stationary (with a constant mean and variance).
This parameter shows how many differences need to be taken to achieve stationarity.
Higher values of d mean more differencing is required.
q (Moving Average Order - Non-seasonal):

This parameter represents how much the current value depends on past forecast errors.
Higher values of q indicate that the current value is influenced by more past errors.
P (Seasonal Autoregressive Order):

Similar to p but for the seasonal part of the data.
It represents the influence of past seasonal values on the current value.
D (Seasonal Differencing Order):

Similar to d but for the seasonal part of the data.
It shows how many differences need to be taken on the seasonal component to achieve stationarity.
Q (Seasonal Moving Average Order):

Similar to q but for the seasonal part of the data.
It represents the influence of past seasonal forecast errors on the current value.
S (Seasonal Period):

This parameter defines the number of time steps in a seasonal cycle.
For example, if you have daily data with a weekly seasonality, S would be 7 because there are approximately 7 days in a week.
